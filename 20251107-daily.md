## Session Overview

**Week Analyzed:** Tuesday, August 6, 2025

**Key Metric:** Todd's new 80% productive work framework

## Quantitative Insights

### Time Allocation Actual vs New Framework

- **Billable Capacity:** 60 hours/month (37.5%) - TO4: 40hrs, TO19: 20hrs

- **BD Target:** 68 hours/month (42.5%) - To reach 80% productive work

- **Overhead Target:** 32 hours/month (20%) - 15% corporate, 5% FBI account

- **Total Framework:** 80% productive work (BD + billable) + 20% overhead

### Energy & Effectiveness Patterns

- **High Energy Blocks:** BD Actions Sync with Aimee, Guidehouse partnership meeting

- **Strategic Coordination:** Multiple 1:1s providing clarity and alignment

- **Personal Integration:** Spontaneous evening with Penny (fast food drive + show completion)

## Qualitative Discoveries

### What Worked Well

Todd 1:1 providing critical strategic clarity on role framework - shifting from rigid 50% billable to flexible 80% productive work target. BD Actions Sync revealing robust proposal pipeline across team (SCOR 31, 38, 41, IRS opportunity). Guidehouse partnership for SCOR 38 creating competitive advantage through 3 former government employees from customer organization. Personal boundary success with spontaneous Penny time despite intensive work day.

### Strategic Breakthroughs

Todd's "good corporate citizen" guidance - help when asked, don't volunteer - directly addressing heroic over-delivery pattern. IC account definitively off table, confirming FBI account strategic focus. Clear overhead allocation framework (15% corporate, 5% FBI) versus previous ambiguous boundaries. TO4 capacity clarification (10 hours/week vs 10 hours/month) significantly improving billable math.

### Framework Evolution

From rigid 50/30/20 allocation to strategic 80% productive work (BD + billable) with flexible internal distribution. Recognition that TO15 overburn limits revenue opportunity, focusing attention on underburning contracts (TO4 primary). Understanding that impactful work quality matters more than pure hour accumulation from Barry.

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

- Monitor Pink Team review feedback (outbrief tomorrow afternoon)

- Leverage Guidehouse partnership insights for SCOR 38 competitive positioning

- Guide TO4 work requests toward strategic value rather than accepting any available hours

### Framework Implementation (Next 2 Weeks)

- Track actual BD + billable hours against 80% target monthly

- Practice "help when asked, don't volunteer" approach to overhead requests

- Optimize TO19 20-hour monthly capacity for highest-value project work

### Long-term Pattern Changes (Next Month)

- Demonstrate sustainable excellence through strategic selectivity

- Build consistent 60-hour monthly billable foundation (TO4 + TO19)

- Maintain BD pipeline quality while hitting 68-hour monthly targets
